Here we are introducing a Project “Industrial Grade Load Equalizer with Centralized Energy Measurement System” (IGLE with CEMS), which can dramatically change the existing problems in the power supply sector during unbalanced loading in electric lines and problem in calculating energy consumption of large number of consumers. Lots of problems are faced due to Phase unbalance, Which is mentioned below. If more consumers are in same Electric section, It is required to install more number of energy meter and is difficult to visit each consumer point to pick up the readings. These two problems can be easily solved by our project. It can be installed for consumers whose power demand is below 5kw and it is well suited for implementing in apartments. For pure industrial usage 3 Phase supply can be directly tapped from this system. 
The heart of this system is an ATMega328p micro controller chip. By the predefined algorithm flashed inside the microcontroller can automatically shift the load to the phase which is least loaded. Current and voltage Sensors are also implemented to sense RMS current and RMS voltage and thereby to calculate Energy consumption. Different types of protections and security features are also included with in the same device. In simple, the need of multiple energy meters in an Apartment and the Phase load unbalance in the Distribution section can be reduced. This system is now designed to handle a load of 4.6KW per channel, it can be increased as it needed.
